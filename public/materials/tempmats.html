<h4>This Page is Heavily Underdone! Expect Issues!</h4>
<p>This is a very brute-forced Proof of Concept that relies on JSON and Javascript. <br>
    I reccomend not using this site until I can adapt everything to work over an actual webserver... <br>
    Nonetheless, this page DOES work, though slow. Just need to have JS enabled.</p>
